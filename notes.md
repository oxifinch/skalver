# Basic loading/saving 
(Do I create separate models/controllers for documents? They are stored in their
respective libraries, so they still need to get THAT information somewhere)

# Editing documents
1. Add Edit button and swap out the view when pressed
2. Make markdown editable with content-editable or something?
3. Add Confirm button and POST new markdown 
4. Render page again with new changes
