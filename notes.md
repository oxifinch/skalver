# Basic loading/saving 
1. Get a library
2. Display user-defined sections
3. Display all documents
4. Load document chapter by chapter when clicked on
(Do I create separate models/controllers for documents? They are stored in their
respective libraries, so they still need to get THAT information somewhere)
